# SER375 - Foundations of Web Development

Web app project with the goal of becoming more comfortable using node.js and packages. This app provided the opportunity to gain experience creating backend API's in Node.js while allowing me to try out typescript. It was enjoyable to design the frontend with vanilla CSS/HTML.
