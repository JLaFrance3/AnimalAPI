                "Black Seadevils are very small fish, much smaller than online pictures would have you believe. They live in tropical waters in the ocean. They have a lot of teeth, very few scales, and a dorsal spine. They also have a bioluminescent 'lure' dangling off of their face.",
                "The bioluminescence is produced by a bacteria absorbed directly from the seawater. Adult male Seadevils don't have lures and also don't eat. The females use their lures to catch crustaceans and small fish. The females are generally much bigger than males and have distended stomachs."
